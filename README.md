# Men's Style Store
Men's Style Store is a fully functional E-commerce website that cater to men's clothing and style needs.
It's allows the customer to select the clothing item for their choice, pick the desired size & quantity and order it directly online via credit card payments. Furthermore the customer can create their personal account which allows them to see their current and past orders.
The purpose of this website is to provide an easy and appealing way for the site owner to run an online business and gain a location independent, pontentially global customer base, as well as for the customer to purchase their desired items regardless of their location.

### Wireframes
I decided to go with three sizez of wireframes, for large screens, medium size screens and small screens. 

Each wireframe contains two main sections, one with an interactive map and the other with weather forecast information such as sunny, cloudy or rainy weather, expected temperatures and so on.

The wireframes were created using - [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/). 

The wireframes for this project can be found [at this link](https://dennischmielewski323696.invisionapp.com/freehand/Mens-Style-Store-WkUKYDrWh)
